## LaserShark Based 3D Printer Host Software

For more information please see http://macpod.net


**Notice: If you are reading this, the software is still pre-alpha. It has been uploaded here for integrators to understand the general json specs and design pattern (which are still likely to change!).**

Want to help? Please consider modifying the libjson-rpc-cpp and libusb finders to work with windows. If someone can verify cinemast's libjson-rpc-cpp works ok with windows (or ports it) that would be a high priority as well. 

Everything else is still under development and likely to change so it is probably not worth modifying aside from if you want to add a new layer processor based on AbstractLaserSharkLayer
